        <h2>Why Computer Club</h2>
        <img class="pic2" src="img/thumbnail_IMG_0473.jpg">
        <p class="Pac1">These students are in Computer Club because they want to learn more about coding and the opportunities that coding and other things with computers can bring you. We take students out for field trips to explore the world of coding. The Computer Club is always open to help new people take an interest in computers.
